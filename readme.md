# Butterchase

Butterchase is a simply text based game created in Python. The premise is simple:

- Hero enters dungeon
- Hero progresses through dungeon to end and/or dies

Just a fun little project I decided to do to keep my Python skills fresh.

I used the game here as a base: https://trinket.io/python/07c3a147aa so big shoutout to that person (was unable to find them on github) for getting me started!

## Setup Checklist

## Usage

Usage is as simple as:

git clone https://github.com/Sudoblark/Butterchase.git
